(ns ipfs-kotobase-test
  "Qualification for `kotobase.storage.ipfs-kotobase` -- the identity/location
  split it exists for (root ADR-2608148200). Runs a real, ephemeral,
  loopback-only HTTP double of the archive contract (raw-CID-keyed PUT/GET)
  rather than stubbing `js/fetch`: nbb/SCI does not reliably let a script
  reassign the global `fetch` binding an already-loaded namespace resolved
  at load time, so a stub silently keeps calling the REAL network -- this
  double avoids that class of false-green entirely, at the cost of a real
  (loopback) socket.

  The larger, full-pipeline check (`unixfs.file/build` -> this client ->
  `unixfs.file/read-file`, byte-for-byte, over the same kind of double) is
  `bin/large_put.cljs` pointed at `bin/mock_archive_server.cljs` (README).
  This suite stays smaller and faster: it proves the client's OWN
  identity/location bookkeeping, not the whole UnixFS round trip."
