  "Qualification for `kotobase.storage.ipfs-kubo` -- the real, independently
  operated Kubo RPC/gateway client (superproject ADR-2608281000 Decision 2).

  Uses an injected fake `kubo/IHttp` rather than a real socket: `open` takes
  an explicit `:http` seam for exactly this reason (see its docstring), which
  sidesteps the `js/fetch`-global-reassignment hazard `ipfs-kotobase-test.cljs`
  documents without needing a real HTTP double."
